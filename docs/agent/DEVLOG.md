# Dev log: 命理大师

Newest first. One entry per working session, key points only.

## 2026-10-26 (c): Phase 1 segment 3, sign-in and account deletion

- Done: `src/auth/`: Argon2id passwords (OWASP params); 15-min HS256 access tokens; rotating refresh tokens with reuse → family revocation; Apple/Google ID-token verification (jose JWKS); captcha after 3 failures (Turnstile proposed), lock after 10; Geo-Rule and age gate at sign-up; keyed email lookup.
- Done: v1 API `/v1/auth/{register,login,oauth,refresh,logout}`, `GET /v1/me`, `DELETE /v1/account` (deletes account, charts, reports and sessions immediately; a report still generating can't write back). Region now comes from the account.
- Done: App sign-in/registration (age confirmation, region at sign-up), tokens in secure storage, single-flight refresh on 401, account page with sign-out and delete. The dev region picker is removed.
- Mistakes: formatter ran in the wrong cwd; PGlite timeout under parallel load (MISTAKES rule 4, global rule 13).
- Harness: PASS (backend 147 tests; app analyze 0 issues, 13 tests, build web).
- Next: Apple/Google buttons in the app need the platform SDKs and client ids; PostgreSQL store; payments (segment 4).

## 2026-10-26 (b): Phase 1 segment 2, v1 API and Flutter app

- Done: chart service and runtime wiring extracted from the demo (`src/service/`) and HTTP helpers (`src/http/`); v1 API with async reports (202 → poll), Idempotency-Key, owner scoping, 451/400/422, `failed` vs compliance holds, dev CORS.
- Done: Flutter app (Riverpod, zh-Hant/zh-Hans/en): 八字 form → 四柱/五行/大運/流年 → AI reading; tarot draw → flip → reading; four-layer report with a fixed AI-label footer; polling.
- Done: `npm run sync:app` copies terms, deck/positions and topics (as generated Dart) plus real engine fixtures into the app; a drift test fails when they're stale. Added all 30 納音 to the protected-term table.
- Mistakes: heredoc again (global rule 1 widened); Dart analysis server crash on the CJK path (harness now uses an ASCII junction); lazy-list and rootBundle traps in widget tests; 流年 cell overflow.
- Harness: PASS. Live smoke test against the API process passed.

## 2026-10-26 (a): Phase 1 segment 1, AI pipeline on DeepSeek

- Done: Narrative → Action → Guard pipeline with structured JSON, grounding (every paragraph cites ChartFact paths), protected-term fixing, rule-layer retry, model review; DeepSeek `deepseek-v4-pro` provider (JSON mode, retries); Claude and mock providers kept.
- Done: six topics (五行, 性格, 事业财运, 婚姻感情, 大运流年, 健康); engine adds 日主, 月令, weighted 五行, 10 years of 流年 with 十神 and 六冲/六合; rules G006 (disease prediction), G007 (investment advice), E002.
- Live: first real report passed on the first attempt, every chart claim checked by hand; 260 s, about USD 0.01.
- Mistakes: curl with Chinese text in Git Bash (global rule 10).

## 2026-10-25: Phase 0, engines, contract, compliance base

- Done: BaziEngine (tzdb + historical DST, true solar time, 节气 by instant), TarotEngine (HMAC-DRBG, audit replay), astrology POC; ChartFact v0.1 schema; keyed input digest; compliance rule set and geo matrix; OpenAPI and PostgreSQL v0; CI; demo UI and CLI.
- Findings: `@gitstrology/engine` fails accuracy (Moon off by up to 8°) → `astronomy-engine` (≤0.005°); Swiss Ephemeris is AGPL; draft regexes blocked our own disclaimers and missed zh-Hant.
- Created the skills in `C:\Users\AgentSkills` (harness-check, mistake-memory, reuse-first).
- Harness: PASS.
